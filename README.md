Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are the state of the art algorithm for sequential data and are used by Apple's Siri and and Google's voice search.
It is the first algorithm that remembers its input, due to an internal memory, which makes it perfectly suited for machine learning problems 
that involve sequential data.

Here, in the following repository RNN is used to detect the fake news spread in reference to the below given dataset.
